# AutoCalc

At the moment, I intend on creating a framework which computes derivitives for functions $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. I later wish this framework to compute gradients for $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ as well as jacobian matrices for $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$
